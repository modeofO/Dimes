# CAD Engine Project Rules - Master Guide

## Overview
This repository contains a professional CAD application built with OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT) for precise parametric modeling and Three.js for browser-based visualization. It serves as a drop-in replacement for OpenSCAD in Daydreams AI workflows.

## Quick Start Checklist

### Initial Setup
- [ ] Clone repository and set up development environment
- [ ] Install OpenCASCADE 7.6+, CMake 3.16+, Node.js 18+
- [ ] Configure Docker development environment using [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml)
- [ ] Set up environment variables from templates

### Development Workflow
- [ ] Create feature branch following Git Flow conventions
- [ ] Implement server-side OCCT geometry operations in [server/src/geometry/](mdc:server/src/geometry)
- [ ] Build client-side Three.js renderer in [client/src/renderer/](mdc:client/src/renderer)
- [ ] Define API endpoints in [server/src/api/](mdc:server/src/api)
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for both server and client
- [ ] Follow commit conventions and run pre-commit hooks

### Integration with Daydreams
- [ ] Implement Daydreams-compatible endpoint at `/api/v1/daydreams/cad`
- [ ] Ensure response format matches existing OpenSCAD workflow
- [ ] Test natural language instruction parsing
- [ ] Verify mesh data transfer to Three.js frontend

## Key Technologies

### Server Stack
- **OpenCASCADE Technology (OCCT)**: Parametric B-Rep modeling kernel
- **C++17**: Primary development language
- **CMake**: Build system
- **Docker**: Containerization and deployment

### Client Stack
- **Three.js**: 3D visualization and rendering
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe client development
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **WebSocket**: Real-time geometry updates

### Integration
- **REST API**: HTTP/JSON communication
- **WebSocket**: Real-time parametric updates
- **Docker Compose**: Development environment orchestration

## Core Concepts

### Parametric Modeling
- All geometry is parameter-driven and updateable
- Features maintain dependencies and relationships
- Changes propagate through the feature tree automatically

### Tessellation Pipeline
- OCCT generates precise B-Rep geometry on server
- Tessellation converts to triangular meshes for Three.js
- Quality vs. performance balance through tessellation settings

### Session Management
- Each user session maintains independent OCCT document
- Persistent state across multiple operations
- Automatic cleanup and resource management

## Performance Considerations

### Server Optimization
- Efficient OCCT memory management with RAII patterns
- Incremental updates (only rebuild changed features)
- Tessellation quality optimization based on viewport requirements

### Client Optimization
- Level-of-detail (LOD) rendering for complex geometries
- Frustum culling and occlusion optimization
- Efficient mesh data transfer using typed arrays

### Network Optimization
- WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
- Response caching strategies
- Compressed mesh data transfer

## File Organization Patterns

### Server Files
```
server/src/
├── geometry/     # OCCT operations and geometry engine
├── api/         # REST API endpoints and controllers
├── tessellation/ # Mesh generation from OCCT shapes
├── export/      # File format export (STEP, STL, etc.)
└── session/     # Session and state management
```

### Client Files
```
client/src/
├── renderer/    # Three.js rendering engine
├── mesh/        # Geometry and mesh management
├── controls/    # User interaction and camera controls
└── api/         # Server communication layer
```

### Shared Types
```
shared/
├── types/       # TypeScript interface definitions
└── protocols/   # API schemas and validation
```

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Geometry Operations
1. Implement OCCT operation in [server/src/geometry/occt_engine.cpp](mdc:server/src/geometry/occt_engine.cpp)
2. Add API endpoint in [server/src/api/cad_controller.cpp](mdc:server/src/api/cad_controller.cpp)
3. Update client communication in [client/src/api/cad-client.ts](mdc:client/src/api/cad-client.ts)
4. Add comprehensive tests for the new operation

### Optimizing Rendering Performance
1. Profile Three.js performance using [client/src/renderer/performance-monitor.ts](mdc:client/src/renderer/performance-monitor.ts)
2. Implement LOD strategies in [client/src/mesh/lod-manager.ts](mdc:client/src/mesh/lod-manager.ts)
3. Optimize tessellation settings in [server/src/tessellation/mesh_generator.cpp](mdc:server/src/tessellation/mesh_generator.cpp)

### Debugging OCCT Issues
1. Enable debug logging in CMake build configuration
2. Use OCCT shape validation functions before operations
3. Check for null shapes and invalid geometry states
4. Analyze OCCT exceptions for detailed error information

## Integration Points

### Daydreams AI Workflow
```
User Chat → Daydreams AI → CAD API → OCCT Engine → Tessellator → Three.js
```

### File Export Pipeline
```
OCCT B-Rep → Multiple Formats (STEP, STL, OBJ, IGES) → Download/Storage
```

### Real-time Updates
```
Parameter Change → WebSocket → Geometry Rebuild → Mesh Update → Three.js Render
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common OCCT Issues
- **Null shapes**: Always validate shapes after operations
- **Memory leaks**: Use proper RAII patterns and smart pointers
- **Boolean failures**: Check geometry validity before operations

### Three.js Performance Issues
- **Low FPS**: Check polygon count and implement LOD
- **Memory growth**: Dispose of unused geometries and textures
- **Rendering artifacts**: Verify mesh normals and indices

### API Communication Issues
- **WebSocket disconnections**: Implement reconnection logic
- **Large mesh transfers**: Use compression and streaming
- **Session timeouts**: Implement proper session lifecycle management
