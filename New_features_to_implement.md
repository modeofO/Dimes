# Features for Future Implementation

*These features should be implemented to the manual workspace and the agent tool calls (actions).*

1. **Manual Drawing on the Workspace**:
   - The user should be able to draw lines, arcs, circles, rectangles on the sketch without specifiying coordinates.

2. **Material Changes**:
   - The user should be able to change the material properties.

3. **Measurements**:
   - The user should be able to measure distances on the pieces (lines, arcs, faces).

4. **3D Fillets and Chamfers**:
   - The user should be able to create fillets and Chamfers in 3D, not just 2D.

5. **Extruded Cut**:
   - The user should be able to make boolean cuts by extruding through a piece to cause a cut.

6. **Extruded Base**:
   - The user should be able to extrude a piece that has a "built-in" 3D fillet (i.e. big square base with rounded cylinder extruding upwards with a smooth transition).

7. **Extruded along a path**:
   - The user should be able to extrude cylindrical pieces along a linear or curved path (i.e. think of making a coil spring).

8. **Threading**:
   - The user should be able to cut threads into a piece.

9. **UI Redesign for Manual Tools to be Drop Downs so Space on the Screen is Conserved**:
   - Currently the workspace is being crowded on both sides by the manual tool section and the scene objects/agent chat section. The agent chat section is most important so it should take precedence on the screen.
